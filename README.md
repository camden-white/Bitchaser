<!-- Description -->
BitChaser is a research project that investigates long-horizon and short-horizon forecasting of the price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) using periodic regressions for long-horizon modeling and time-series analysis for short-horizon forecasting. The project analyzes historical daily OHLC data and relevant financial statistics.

## Status

🚧 Active development. Core project structure is complete; forecasting models are currently under implementation.

## Features

- Historical Bitcoin OHLC analysis
- Statistical forecasting models
- Data visualization
- Reproducible research workflow
- Documentation with MkDocs

## Research Objectives

BitChaser investigates questions including:

- Can Bitcoin support and resistance be modeled statistically?
- What periodic structures exist in BTC/USD?
- How accurately can daily OHLC values be forecast?
