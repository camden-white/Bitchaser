<!-- Description -->
BitChaser is a research project that investigates long-horizon and short-horizon forecasting of the Bitcoin (BTC/USD) market using statistical modeling and deep learning. The project analyzes historical daily OHLC data, develops interpretable long-horizon forecasting models along with short-horizon time-series prediction models.

## Status

🚧 Active development. Core project structure is complete; forecasting models are currently under implementation.
