<!-- Description -->
BitChaser is a research project that investigates long-horizon and short-horizon forecasting of the Bitcoin (BTC/USD) market using statistical modeling and deep learning. The project analyzes historical daily OHLC data, develops interpretable long-horizon forecasting models along with short-horizon time-series prediction models.

## Status

🚧 Active development. Core project structure is complete; forecasting models are currently under implementation.

## Features

- Historical Bitcoin OHLC analysis
- Statistical forecasting models
- Data visualization
- Reproducible research workflow
- Documentation with MkDocs

## Research Objectives

BitChaser investigates questions including:

- Can Bitcoin support and resistance be modeled statistically?
- What periodic structures exist in BTC/USD?
- How accurately can daily OHLC values be forecast?
