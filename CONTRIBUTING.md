# Contributing to BitChaser

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BitChaser. This guide explains
how to set up the project, validate changes, and follow the repository's coding
standards.

## Development

### Workflow

1. `make fix`\
Auto-fix lint issues and format code to standards

2. `make precommit`\
Update trees, fix whitespace/newlines, run all hooks

3. `make ci`\
Run ci checks (lint, format check, type check, and run tests with coverage)

4. `git status` or `git diff` (optional)\
Review unstaged changes

5. `git add <files>`\
Stage files for commit

6. `git commit -m "[message]"`\
Commit files with message explaining change

7. `git push`\
Upload commits to GitHub

### Documentation

Build documentation (MkDocs)
```bash
make docs
```

Serve docs on local host (MkDocs)
```bash
make serve
```

### Coding Conventions

- Follow PEP 8 and use Ruff for formatting and linting with `make formatcheck`, `make lint`, and `make fix`.
- Add type hints to all public functions and methods, and check with `mypy`.
- Write concise docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions.
- Keep code DRY.
